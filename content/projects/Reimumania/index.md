<!-- ### Lessons Learned

- An effective project manager must have the game planned out with good documentation, at least with the main details, before development and not during. Prioritizing things properly is nearly impossible without it.
- People in a team need to frequently meet to stay up-to-date with each other, especially when there isn't thorough documentation.
- It is always better to underscope something and add more later, then it is to overscope and be forced to cut ideas out right before a deadline.
- Every action in a game needs to give the player some type of feedback, such as a sound effect or animation. -->
