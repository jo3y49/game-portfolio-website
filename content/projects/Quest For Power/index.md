<!-- ### Lessons Learned

- As a lead programmer, it's important to make sure everyone is consistently on the same page from the beginning, otherwise it gets harder to coordinate tasks.
- Deadlines need to be set throughout the development process to ensure most of the work isn't being done at the end.
- A lot of time needs to be dedicated to play testing for a game to go from functional to fun.
- It can't be assumed that the mechanics will make sense to the player just because it does to the developers. Some kind of instructions/tutorial is necessary.

### Future Plans

- Do more playtesting for better difficulty balancing.
- Add a tutorial to help players know how the mechanics work.
- Once these updates are made, put it on Steam and consider expanding the game into something much bigger with the team. -->
