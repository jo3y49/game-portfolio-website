### Technologies & Tools

- **Java**: Programming language for game development.
- **GitHub**: Version control and code repository.
- **VSCode**: Code editor for development.
- **Blender**: 3D models and UV maps.

### Role & Contributions

- Worked in a team of 2 with another classmate.
- Primarily focused on the networking, ai behavior, and implementation of 3D models and textures. Assisted with the physics as well.

### Implemented Gameplay Features

- Ability to connect with other players on the network.
- Featured a character selection screen, and the selected character is shown to other players on the network.

### Game Description

CraftMine Parkour is a 3D platformer made in my game architecture class. The objective is to reach the highest block in the sky. Each time you reach it, you gain a point. To get more points, you must touch the ground, then go back up again. Beware the roaming enemies, or you will get launched.

<!-- ### Lessons Learned

- There are a ton of aspects to a game that can be easy to overlook.
- Game physics requires a lot of tuning to get it to work as intended. -->
